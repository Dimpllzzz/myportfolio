			<p style="padding:25px 20% 0 20%">Being open-minded and creative, helps me to explore different subjects and come up with unique ideas in my academic work. As an introvert, I excel at focused, independent study, but sometimes I find it challenging to participate in group activities. I usually feel content, which keeps me motivated and stress-free in school. My hobbies, like drawing and researching, enhance my critical thinking and problem-solving skills. However, I must be careful not to oversleep, and the structured nature of some classes can stifle my creativity.</p>

			<h2>My Motto</h2>
			
			<h3><em>"Progress, Not Perfection"</em></h3>
			<p style="padding: 0 20% 0 20%;">This motto is a reminder that it's okay to make mistakes and that the pursuit of excellence is an ongoing journey. It encourages a growth mindset and a focus on continuous improvement rather than getting discouraged by setbacks. Embracing <em>"Progress, Not Perfection"</em> can help you maintain resilience and a positive attitude in the face of challenges.</p>
			
			<h2>Personality Test</h2>
			<img src="../Assets/Images/results.png">
			<p style="padding: 25px 20% 25px 20%">In general, personality tests can provide valuable insights into an individual's character and behavioral tendencies, their validity and accuracy are often questioned. These tests are based on self-reporting, which can be influenced by various factors such as mood, context, and the desire to present oneself in a favorable light. Their results should be taken with a degree of caution.<br>However, in my case the results of the test were accurate to an extent in my own eyes these results may be inaccurate from the view of a friend or acquaintance.</p>
