		<h1>PARIS SCOTT</h1>
		<h2><a style="color: lightcyan;">Student</a></h2>
		<p>Hello, I'm Paris Scott, an 18-year-old student currently attending the University of Technology. I have a deep passion for both the creative and literary arts. In my free time, you can often find me immersed in the world of books, where I explore different genres and expand my horizons through reading. Additionally, I love expressing my creativity on canvas and paper, whether it's through painting or drawing. These artistic outlets allow me to communicate my thoughts and feelings in a unique and visually appealing way.<br><br>When I'm not engaged in my hobbies, you might catch me enjoying some well-deserved rest, as I believe in the importance of recharging and taking care of one's well-being. I'm excited to embark on this journey of personal and academic growth at the University of Technology and look forward to the opportunities and experiences that lie ahead.</p>
